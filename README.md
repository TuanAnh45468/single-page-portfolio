## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    - Any field is empty
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save
  the enquiries)
- **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design
